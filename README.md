#Summary of U.S. Energy Analysis: Major Findings from Project 1

#How has U.S. nonrenewable and renewable energy supply and consumption changed over time?

We examined energy data within the U.S. dating back to 1990. We found that over time, the fossil fuel and nonrenewable market was only slightly disrupted by renewable energy. The relationship between supply and consumption showed to be positive; as supply increased over time, consumption would follow. 

#Has renewable energy had any influence on nonrenewable energy consumption?

Yes, but not to the extent we hypothesized. While it’s clear there has been a small disruption in the fossil fuel and nonrenewable market, we believe it may still be due to undocumented geopolitical events. 

#How have CO2 emissions changed over time and what is their relationship between the two forms of energy?

Overtime, carbon emissions have demonstrated to follow in the footsteps of consumption. This demonstrates that as we consume energy we are simultaneously feeding our environment with CO2 emissions. Additionally, we found that as renewable energy consumption started to rise, carbon emissions from fossil fuels eventually started to fall, with the exception of natural gas. And while carbon emissions from petroleum are rising again it’s still well below its peak in 2005.

#Does increasing renewable energy production and consumption reduce total CO2 emissions?

Based on our findings, we believe renewable energy production and consumption has reduced total CO2 emissions, as there is a negative relationship between the emission rates of coal and petroleum, while natural gas continues to demonstrate a positive correlation with renewables. 

#How have fossil fuel prices changed over time?

In regards to price, the fossil fuel market has demonstrated to have more volatility over time. 

#Is there a correlation between increasing renewable energy production and consumption and fossil fuel prices?

We examined the price of each nonrenewable energy price over the last thirty years. We found there’s a common trend with supply/consumption of the big three energy sources and the overall price in the market had a positive correlation with supply and consumption rates, with the exception of coal. As renewable energy resources came into the market, it leads to having a negative effect on coal consumption in the U.S.
